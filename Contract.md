# Master Thesis Contract

We have attempted to find models for predicting the location of the hearth and internal chambers and has been unsuccessfull, we will therefore develop a model for predicting hearth chambers on CT and or PET scans.

We will do this by working on Rigshospitalet for the duration of the thesis to not deal with GDPR problems; there we will find out how to annotate the 3d-images properly. We will then import the data into tensorflow and tweak parameters untill we have a model that can predict the location of the hearth (and possible it's internal chambers) and describe the process and results in a scientifically written paper which we will submit for scientific review.

We have created a Gantt-diagram for having a rough milestone plan, which we will expand on during the thesis, which we intend to use throughout the thesis.

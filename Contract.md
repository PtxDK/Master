## Background/motivation (incl. key concepts & terminology).
With increasing automation and efficiency optimization in hospitals, it is crucial to have well-behaving models for predicting locations of various parts of the human body's organs in order to minimize human effort, and therfore also lower the cost of processing patients.

## A problem statement.
We have attempted to find models for predicting the location of the left ventricle and other chambers of the heart and have been unsuccessful, we will therefore develop a model for predicting heart chambers on CT and or PET scans.


## Our Proposal
We hypothesize that the task of segmentation of the left ventricle (and ideally other heart chambers) may be approached by the recently proposed multi-planar Unet (MPU) segmentation method that provides a statistically and computationally efficient model for anatomical 3D structures and their appearance. Further, we hypothesize that the performance of the MPU may be improved by combining it with the Probabilistic U-net or other similar methods.




## Learning Objectives
- Annotation of data (where is the hearth chamber)
- Learning to build our own models/neural networks
- Optimization of hyper parameters in a medical setting
- Application of neural networks on medical scans
  - CT
  - PET
- Work with 3d data



# Further objectives
As stated above our main goal is to be able to predict the location of the left ventricle in the heart. If there is more time left in the thesis we will make an attempt for the following:
- Prediction of Location of rest of heart collectively
- Prediction of Location of all heart chambers individually
- prediction on if the patient will need heart surgery for a heart defect
- Prediction when the patient will need heart surgery

These the above proposed tasks are not the main goal of this theis merely a ramification of what can be researched next.

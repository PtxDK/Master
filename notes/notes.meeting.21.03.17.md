# Notes
- the hyper parameters
- try using single view mpunet
  - to compare results
- train with fewer views
- create an idea before testing an idea
- try to get the batch sizes to match
  - 111 for 2d unet
  - 1 in 3d unet
  - to make sure we are comparing the same things
  - 3d wont be able to use batch normalization
- do a bounding box around the heart
  - this can cause a problem that it is over solving the problem before we work on it
- can resample down -> run -> resample up
  - use on CT scan
  - use on 3D unet
- get visualization of the results from training
- if we want to compare with the article for mpunet
  - contact mathias
  - what is the hyperparameters used for the results in the article
  - is the train hparams the same used for the model in the article
- Data augmentation
  - can improve

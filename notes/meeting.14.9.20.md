# Notes
- flemming would like the annotations after we have compeleted our work
- erik has a system in MATLAB
- there can be a problem
- there was person that can help us with annotating the scans
- we can get the program that erik has made
- we have to define some data
- plan which ones to annotate between CT and PET
- choose the test and train set to some what match
- FET and someother
  - FET is an odd case
- break down in what can we test
- look at what can be wrong with the heart
  - clinical score or diagnosis that can be used
- split based on
  - operation or not
  - age
- might be too early to say
  - dont know if CT or Pet is better
  - how easy is it for each 
  - how long does it take to segement each extra section after left ventricle
- make room to expand
- we get no points for annotating the data
- maybe instead annotate the whole heart and the left ventricle
- MR scans might not be a problem since this is a computer science problem and not a riget problem solving problem.
- we can compare methods based on scan types
- the primary results dont need to be from low dose CT scans and PET
- look at what can be done to extend
- use some data to enforce the ideas from
- use the MR scans
- we can send a link to erik to check if it is a good source
- report as a article is not a final 


For next time
annotation tool
mr scans how valid are the annotations

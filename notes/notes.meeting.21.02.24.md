# Notes
- research if there are some improvements to be done on patient selection
  - who is healthy
  - who is sick
- might not be project breaking
- sick patients are harder to segment
- how do we go forward with using the segemtation mask 
  - improve the segmentations
  - use for diagnostic projects
- start with the ventricle
- move to other parts later
- focus on what methods are used
  - focus on the computer science aspect
- use mpunet
  - what can be further improved
  - why did it fail?
    - what is it that makes it fail
      - what sections of the heart
- view as 3d image that can be sliced along axes
- look at using liver to give "context" to model
  - have subset that has segmentation for both
- what is the dice score
  - how good does the metric need to be
- look at 3D segmentation with unet
- use some code from perslev
- plan how we want to annotate the data
  - what parts to take

- report
  - introduction
    - what is the problem
    - what have others done
    - what is the method we will use
    - what problems did they have
    - what combinations can be done 

- what other things should we consider
- create tiny set of data to use for testing
- look at what problems there are with the left ventricle
  - does the form of it create problems
  - how

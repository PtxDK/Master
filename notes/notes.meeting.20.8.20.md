- no flemming this time
- what other projects are there
- try to have it overlapp with other projects that erik is working on
- try to see if there is a section that can use the project
- make sure this has enough data
- what could we like to work with
- patrick would like to work with some form of automization for basic processes
  - create something that can be used
- erik would prefer to work with something that can be used
- reasearch that the project can focus on the method and not the software aroud it.
- find a better balance between the time for the method and the time for the software.
- (idea) might be better to focus on the method if we need to train a network
- figure out where our priorities are
  - base thesis
    - prototype of a solution
  - nice to have thesis
  - stretch goal
    - implement the solution
    - very large maybe
- something that can be used might be a stretch goal
- create a concrete list of projects that we can work on
  - segmenteation of the sections of the brain
  - segmenttaion of tumors
- the areas should be something researched by the supported(vejleder)
- erik has worked with
  - brain sections and structure
  - segmentation of tumors
- we need scans to be there
- we need annotation of the scans
- there needs to be enough scans that we can use something statistically signifigant
- with the hipppocampus scans how would we have the output for alzeihmers **?**
  - single value on a scale?
  - multihot encoding [0 1 0]
- with brain scans we can look at many areas
  - trauma patiients
  - stroke
  - alzeimers
  - dimentia
  - asymmerty within the brain
- look at annotations that are available
- find some method for explainable AI
  - where we can find the variables that show why the network has leaned one way or the other
- can be a method wher we allow for unsupervised training or semisupervised learning
  - supervised is where we hyperfocus on the annotations
  - semi is look at any connection that can create the result
  - unsupervised is un likely to be used.
- have a contract simply as insurance that we dont potentially waste an attempt
- do we just want the thesis done or do we want the possibility of doing PH.D

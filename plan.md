# Plan for more coding
- check that the dice score matches over sizes
  - does shrink inflate dice score?

- generate images of slices
  - scans
  - labels
  - data augmentations
    - max
    - min

- create metric to define how good the model is based on our goals
  - how many hearts have given dice score

- Hyperparameter tuning
  - test scales
  - define scales
  - define hparams we to test

- train 3 models
  - 2d unet
  - 3d unet
  - mpunet

- train 2d unet augmentation

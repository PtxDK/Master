# Plan
- Retrival of Data
  - login to syng via
  - select patitents
  - start 5
  - end 40-80
  - transfer to titans
  - notes for selection
    - Rb
    - stress scan
    - rest scan
    - AC_CT_CARDIAC_1

- Annontation of data
  - contact person about annotations
    - talk to flemming about the perosn to talk to about annotations
  - annotate the data
    - only the left ventricle
    - which program to use for annotation
      - find out which program to use for annotation
    - how do we export/save data
    - **?**does the data need to leave the titans?
  - what is the file format output?
  - which file format should it be

- Load data into tensorflow
  - setup venv
  - select tensorflow version
    - which are compatible with the titans
  - setup project structure
  - setup gitignore file
  - any scripts to save here
  - **?**which titan can we use
    - queue
    - or specific titan
  - setup code to load the data
  - **?**what format does the image need to be to be loaded into the model
  - **?**how do we load dicom data into tensorflow
  - what is the correct classification or regression
  - what should the output be
    - image shape
    - ouptut information

- Build Models
  - read up on the methods
    - supporting material
    - general unet
    - probabalistic u net
    - multi planar u-net
    - shape models
    - general cardiac information
  - find the correct loss function for use
  - are there other loss functions that can be used
  - code the models
  - find parameters that can be fine tuned
  - are there other methods that can augment the above
  - lookup if there are any pretrained versions that can help
  - train the model
  - prpare loss function
  - setup train to allow for different models
    - do different models need different dataloading

- Metric Selection
  - save some of the examples from the training epochs
  - save the weights from different epochs
  - what metrics are interesting to represent information
  - basic loss or acuracy graph across epochs
  - what areas of the heart are being used

- Write thesis
  - structure Sections
  - what type are we going for
    - article **vs**
    - report
  - what sections are there to write
    - general information
    - medical information
      - structure of heart
      - technical that affect our setup
    - model specific information
  - rereading thesis
  - editing
  -
